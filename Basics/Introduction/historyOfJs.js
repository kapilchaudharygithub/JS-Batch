 * 
 */


/**JAVASCRIPT
 * 
 * --> It is a scripting lannguage that conforms to the EcmaScript Specification
 * --> It's the most widely known and used implementation of EcmaScript

 *
 */

/**Node JS
 * 
 * -->An open source, cross-platform,server-side runtime for JS.
 * 
 */

/**BUN
 * 
 * -->Other than the fact 'JS' is single threaded, 'Node JS' is slow (Multiple reasons for it).
 * --> Some smart peoples said they wanted to re-write the JS runtime for BE and introduced BUN.
 * --> It is significantly faster runtime.
 * --> It is written in 'ZIG' Programming language.
